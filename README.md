ðŸ“Š Options Flow Analyzer
This project is a Python-based tool designed to process options flow CSV files, filter significant trades (like sweeps), calculate price discounts, and score option entries based on timing and other criteria. It also includes functions to print the cleaned data in a readable format using pandas.

You will need a CSV file of the options flow data. I also have a version that automatically retrieves this data using web scraping. Additionally, you will need a Tradier API key.
